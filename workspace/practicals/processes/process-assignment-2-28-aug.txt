1.  Difference between system call and function call:

System Call:
    - A function provided by the kernel to enter kernel mode to access a resource.
    - Context switching happens in system call.
    - Allow the program to access memory or a hardware resource from the kernel.

Function Call:
    - A request made by a program that execute a predefined function.
    - No Context switch occurs in function call.
    - Helps to pass control to a specific function to execute a task.

2. Prototype of WAIT() function: the wait function suspends execution of the current process until a child has exited.
    - Prototype:
        #include <sys/wait.h>
        pid_t wait( int* status );
